# duo-extension

A simple chrome extension to store DUO login codes in, so that you don't have to pull out your phone everytime you want to login to MyUCLA.

Usage:
Clone the repository, and head over to chrome://extensions. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the directory you cloned into, and you should see the icon in `icon.png` pop up in the toolbar, indicating that the extension is loaded. 

Click on the extension, and click the "Change codes" button to enter in some new duo codes. Use until they're all used, then repeat.
